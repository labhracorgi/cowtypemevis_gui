MeVisLab GUI:

This folder should contain:
	- (Functional) / gui_nameing_types.mlab / A MeVisLab GUI used to select the types.
	- (Functional) pandas_collecter.py 	/ A Python script for collecting and 
		translating to notation. Possibly it could be enough to have a script that 
		collects them to pandas format.
	- (Functional) /chemical_horikoshi_parser.py / A Python script that uses 
		the results from "pandas_collecter.py" to parse them 
		into a single type only represented by a string.	
	- (Not created) / type_comparison.py / A Python script for comparing 
		with automatic traces.
		It could base itself on a lot of loading syntax from the parser;
		except that two different collective csvs will be loaded.
	- (Functional) / to_horikoshi2002_parser.py / A Python script to convert raw binary arrays to
		a format which is comparable with the classification used by Horikoshi (2002).
	- (Functional) / to_krabbehartkamp1998_parser_new.py / A Python script to convert
		raw binary arrays to a format which is compatible with the classification
		used by Krabbe-Hartkamp 1998.
	- (Functional) / R_code_read_csv.R / An R script which just shows exactly how the final csv 
		created by the other scripts can be loaded into R without loss of information. 
		Since I personally believe R to be greater for statistical calculations.
