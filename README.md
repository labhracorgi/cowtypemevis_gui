# Circle of Willis Type selector - MeVisLab GUI:

## Software and version used:
Python Version 2.7.13 - Anaconda2 build
MeVisLab Version 3.0.1 (2017-08-20 Release)
R Version 3.4.2

## Remember to:
- Set the correct paths; see File Structure.
- Nothing else should not need to be tampered with to work.

## "Recommended" File Structure:
Overall project folder with:
- Code folder
- Images folder sorted by ID folders
- Folder with progress cache and collected/translated csv files.

## Remarks:
The GUI might be a little buggy regarding its buttons in the View3D module in MeVisLab. Suspect that the issue arose from zooming, but no workaround has been tempted.
